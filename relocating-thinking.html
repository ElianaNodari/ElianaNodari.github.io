            <section class="intro">
                <p>In his March 2025 lecture at Princeton University, Ted Chiang compared using artificial intelligence for essay writing to bringing a <strong>"forklift into the weight room"</strong> (Chiang, 2025). This striking analogy underscores a traditionalist view: that the struggle of choosing words and constructing sentences is not merely the labor of writing, but the very "strength training" required for intellectual growth.</p>
                
                <p>However, a parallel transformation in the world of software engineering, championed by programmer Steve Yegge, suggests that while AI may remove the "weights" of syntax and sentence construction, it does not necessarily remove the thinking. Instead, it shifts the cognitive center of gravity upward, moving the human mind from the role of a manual laborer to that of a strategic architect.</p>

                <h3>The Relocation of Cognition: From Micro to Macro</h3>
                <p>The central tension in the current debate over AI and intelligence lies in where the "thinking" is perceived to happen. For Chiang, thinking is synonymous with the transcription of thought—the granular struggle with the sentence. If a machine handles the word choice, Chiang argues, the student "avoids the mental exertion necessary for intellectual growth" (Chiang, 2025). This perspective defines the sentence as the fundamental unit of cognition.</p>

                <p>Yet, as noted in the provided essay, legendary programmer Steve Yegge offers a different paradigm through what he calls <strong>"vibe coding."</strong> With over 45 years of experience building systems at Google and Amazon, Yegge describes a reality where developers no longer type individual lines of code but instead orchestrate AI agents through natural language "prompts" (Yegge, 2025). In this environment, thinking has not disappeared; it has relocated. The programmer's focus shifts from "How do I implement this function?" to broader architectural questions regarding scaling, security, and system coherence.</p>

                <p>This transformation represents a move from <em>execution</em> to <em>curation</em>. In the context of an essay, this means the writer's primary intellectual work shifts from the "bricks" of individual sentences to the "blueprints" of the entire argument. The cognitive load is no longer spent on the mechanics of grammar but on the higher-order task of assessing whether an argument holds, whether evidence is sufficient, and whether the structural logic is sound.</p>

                <h3>Cognitive Offloading as a Double-Edged Sword</h3>
                <p>This shift in the cognitive center is a form of <strong>cognitive offloading</strong>—the act of using external tools to reduce the mental
