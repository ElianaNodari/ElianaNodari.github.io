            <p>
                Hello! My name is <strong>Eliana Nodari</strong>. I am currently a student enrolled in ENGL 170, where I am exploring the intersections of academic research, creative storytelling, and digital composition.

                This blog serves as a digital portfolio for my writing projects throughout the semester. Here, you will find my reflections, drafts, and polished pieces as I develop my voice and refine my rhetorical skills.
